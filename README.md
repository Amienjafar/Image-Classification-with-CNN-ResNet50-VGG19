# Image-Classification-with-CNN-ResNet50-VGG19

An experiment was conducted by comparing the two CNN models, namely VGG19 and ResNet50. Both use Adam optimization

The results showed that VGG19 got better results, which was 97%, while ResNet50 only got 83%.

Of course, this is not a valid result due to many influencing factors such as the use of optimization techniques, datasets, and the use of other processing techniques.

The dataset uses the data on the kaggle website
